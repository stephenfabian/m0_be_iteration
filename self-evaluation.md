# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
A: Quite confident.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
A: I had a productive struggle, the iterations lesson didn't take more than 40 min or so which felt quick to me.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
A: As far as this lesson go, I don't feel I need a ton of practice on each iterations.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
A:I'm curious to see how complex each iterations will work with multiple if statements.  I expect we'll get to that topic in the near future.
